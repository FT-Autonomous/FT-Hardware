Ignore the file "screw it" - it is for the screw bit on the modem casing top if it snaps off, but realistically just reprint it.
The STL files should match the SolidWorks files, same with the 3mf files - those are optimised for a Bambu A1.
The modem insides file is inaccurate. It is loosely right, but is particularly wrong around the I/O interface.

You should be able to just directly print from the 3mf files and it should work, but you might have to sand around the I/O connectors.
