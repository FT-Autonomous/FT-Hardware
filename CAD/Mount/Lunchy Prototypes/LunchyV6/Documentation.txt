##Main changes:
- potentially an O-ring design might work printed out of TPU or used just around where the openings are. Biggest question is where they will go. Perhaps best if they go around where the holes go and we use screws with fasteners to ensure a tight fit to Lunchy.
- I also want to explore adding the camera mount as an attachment to the base plate.

##Plan after reviewing logistics
- Having screws interface with the sponsor board 
- Do a picture frame design, covered in the Lunchy MS Whiteboard.
- Focus on adding camera mount to base plate secondly as should be easier concept to incorporate into Lunchy (but separate thing to Lunchy).

##Still needed to change
- Need to add in wall positioning for modem casing to slot
- Need to add in screw holes for connecting base plate to lunchy body.


(Note on naming of files - once I update a file from the previous model or remake it, the number changes to the current version. If the design ends up with 0 changes between version x and x+1, the name stays.) product_x
