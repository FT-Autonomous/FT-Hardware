##Active fixes needed in V5:
- It looks hella ugly.
- The vent should be split in 2 and moved to the sides. Hot air gathers more there, and for structural integrity 2 smaller ones are better.
- Dimensions are wrong for the camera as this year we are switching from the Zed 2 to the Zed 2i


##Goals for V5:
- Add sponsorship tile compatibility
	- Add 1mm to each Lunchy dimenstion, then make the wall 3mm thick, finally cut back wall by 1mm on the smooth edges. 
	- Divide the wall out to add the 3mm holes for sponsor wall.
- Add a computer frame that can fit within lunchy - "Skips"
- Accommodate Z2i in Skips and Lunchy cutout

##Choices made in V5:
Maximized creating fillets on any long straight corner - this reduces elephant footing and warping in the 3d printing process.
I am concerned that the number of holes on each side might reduce the waterproofing, I know they will be covered with sponsors, but it is an extra point of failure.
        - will create alternate Lunchy where each panel is one side of the case, then we can fuck with sponsors on that panel. Body stays the same each year, but panel gets reprinted.
